# Port-based V2Ray Configs

This repository provides categorized V2Ray/Trojan/Shadowsocks configurations aggregated from public sources.
The README is partially dynamic: three sections are auto-updated by `categorize_all_protocols.py`.

## Statistics (Protocol Ã— Common Ports)
<!-- START-STATS -->
<!-- END-STATS -->

> (The above table shows protocols as rows and common ports as columns. Totals are shown in last row/column.)

## Subscription Links (popular ports only)
<!-- START-LINKS -->
<!-- END-LINKS -->

For the full list of ports / files see the `detailed/` folder.

## Sources & Summary
<!-- START-SOURCES -->

## Notes
- The script writes subscription files to `sub/` and detailed per-protocol files to `detailed/`.
- README will contain only links to files (not inline config content) to keep size small.
- If you want additional ports to appear in the README, add them to `COMMON_PORTS` in the script.
